Hello and welcome to Animation Nation, a project for Hacktoberfest 2021! This site aims to showcase your talent :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------Rules-----------------------

The rules are simple. You have to:

How to contribute

1: Fork this repository

2:Clone your repository that you are forked

      git remote add origin https://github.com/<Your github Name>/100daysOfCode.git

3: Before you make any changes, keep your fork in sync to avoid merge conflicts:

       git remote add upstream https://github.com/<Your github Name>/100daysOfCode.git
       git pull upstream master/main

4:After adding the upstream and checking that all files are up to date, we now will create newbranch before editing any files. There are two ways to do so:

       git checkout -b <branch-name> (Preferrably your Name)
       git branch <branch-name>
       git checkout <branch-name>

5:Commit the changes that you made

     git commit -m "Add your message/changes you made"

6:Finally push the changes to the repository

     git push origin <your branch name>
